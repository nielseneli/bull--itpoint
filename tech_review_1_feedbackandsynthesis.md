# Audience Feedback
## Possible Failure Points
Delayed reveals (e.g. “Today I’m going to be talking to you about the most important thing ever.... Bananas!”)
Smooth topic changes are unclear for parsing
Transitioning or declaring new slides non-explicitly
How much should we be allowing bullshit for creating graphs over pulling up a graph and forcing the speaker to go with it? There’s a balance to be struck there, and we’re not sure where it is yet
What if you mess up? What if the computer messes up? Is there a way to go back?
## Feature Suggestions
Signals for keywords could include pauses, intonation, and volume of speech
Voice inputs with clicker input for parsing help (e.g. hold down button when saying “graph” to create a new graph)
“Talk slower” light or signal if the computer starts getting behind?
Include options for inserting pre-created images easily from a local folder for specific needed graphs or images
Include pre-created general graphs (e.g. “general upward trend”) in the system’s knowledge so it can label axes and just output to the screen if a vague graph is needed
Find related words/use a thesaurus for putting things on a slide if necessary?
Clipart, giphy, and other image or media being pulled
OpenCV for gestures -- how do we make these not awkward though?

# Next steps
## For learning and feature improvement
Look at TED talks for key words and body language
Read papers or research done on “iconic gestures”
Go through the suggestions of features and decide what we want to implement, and in what order
Continue doing “user testing” in the forms that we did, and modulate it for what stage of development we’re in, because that was incredibly useful
Talk to more people and get more ideas!
# Reflection on Process
Our line of questioning for the audience during this technical review was very UX-based, which was incredibly helpful, and gave us both some really good insights on things to look out for and things to possibly include.
For the next technical review, we’ll probably want to ask more actually technical questions. This is dual-purposed: we’ll both be farther along in our implementation and probably need less styling and design guidance, and we also got really good feedback from this review on all of this stuff already.
