# Bull--itPoint's Trajectory
Despite this being a class project in the Spring of 2016, the team is continuing to work on this product 
because it's really interesting to us and has a lot of potential to be really useful and cool when we get it 
working to the level we want it to.

## Improvements
### Short Term Goals
- Move keypress to buttons on a bluetooth clicker
- Add more commands to framework
- Explore trying to send audio packages in closer to real time to minimize delay
- Implement more APIs for scraping information (e.g. Bing Images, Getty Images, etc.)

### Longer Term Goals
- Make commands more natural by attempting a form of less rigid framework (e.g. AI or machine learning 
from recorded presentations such as TED talks)
- Implement serious vs. BS modes to personalize the software for different use cases

Feel free to suggest anything you'd like to see! We're incredibly open to new ideas. Thanks in advance!
