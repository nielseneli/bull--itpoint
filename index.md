# What is Bull--itPoint?

Quick and easily understandable explanation of what your project is all about. Consider including a narrative or example use case, e.g. via screenshots, video, or story boarding.

Bull--itPoint is a flexible presentation software. It creates a slide deck in real time while you present, which aims toencourage and support more presentation styles and more procrastination. 

# Use Cases

We anticipate Bull--itPoint being used by:
* people who are more comfortable when they "just wing it"
* people who procrastinate on their projects they have to present for (We don't know anyone like this. Definitely not.)
* people who have an agile presentation style and end up ad-libbing a significant amount to get their points across 

# Example of Finished Presentation Format

No idea how to get a demo in here.
