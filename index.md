# What is Bull--itPoint?

Bull--itPoint is a flexible presentation software. It creates a slide deck in real time while you present, which aims to encourage and support more presentation styles and more procrastination. 

# Use Cases

We anticipate Bull--itPoint being used by:

1. people who are more comfortable when they "just wing it"

2. people who procrastinate on their projects they have to present for (We don't know anyone like this. Definitely not.)

3. people who have an agile presentation style and end up ad-libbing a significant amount to get their points across 

4. people who are preparing for a presentation and experimenting with different orders of presentation, and don't want to spend their time shuffling slides until they get it right

# Finished Presentation Format

We're using `reveal.js` for our ouput as slides. You can view a sample presentation [here](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/ "Sample reveal.js presentation"), or download Bull--itPoint and try it for yourself!
